image-sound-sync
================

This application is intended to allow the user to synchronise an audio track with a set of stop motion type images.  It provides a way to match key image frames with events in the audio track, and will then use the most significant audio events between the key frames to automatically assign the transition times for the remainder of the images.

Once the images and audio are synced the program can run the session in a presentation mode.
